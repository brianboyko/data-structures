/* 

Requirements:
  No arrays! Instead, use an object with numeric keys.
  Pass all the tests (open SpecRunner.html in a browser).

Functional instantiation with shared methods: same as step 1, but with shared methods
Do:
  Work within the src/functional-shared/ folder.
   Create an object that holds the methods that will be shared by all instances of the class.
   You'll need to use the keyword this in your methods.
   Use _.extend to copy the methods onto the instance.
Don't:
   Use the keyword new or prototype chains

Example: https://github.com/makersquare/giraffeMaker/blob/master/src/giraffeExtend.js

var Stack = function() {
  // Hey! Rewrite in the new style. Your code will wind up looking very similar,
  // but try not not reference your old code in writing the new style.
};
